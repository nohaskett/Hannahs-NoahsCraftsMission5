    <p style="color:black;">
        Hi! My name is Hannah. I am 23 years old, and I am an army brat. My dad flew us all over the world for work, and I have lived in Panama, Italy, and Japan for a time. I just graduated from BYU in Physiology and Developmental Biology, and I am currently going to Nursing School. I hope to work in the NICU when I become a full-time nurse, and I want to make a diference in Healthcare!

        I picked up crocheting after my husband Noah and I got married. My first projecct was actually a bag made out of grocery bags that I made to reduce plastic waste! After that, I decided to test my abilities and try to make blankets, sweaters, and other fun crafts. I am compltely self-taught, and have even busted out my Grandma's sewing machine for a Quilt-jacket I wanted to make. I love crocheting, and I am excited to teach anyone who would want to learn!'
